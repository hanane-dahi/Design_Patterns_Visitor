# Design_Patterns_Visitor
The Visitor design pattern allows you to add methods to classes of different types without much altering to those classes. You can make completely different methods depending on the class used with this pattern.
In the beginning, we created the Visitor interface, and we implemented the visitor interface using TaxVisitor class. We act as no taxes existed of any type on products when you buy them and our job is to implement taxes however implement them in a way so that the different types of products being either fruits, vegetables, or clothes items are taxed in completely different ways and then what we’re going to do is create the visible interface and it is going to have a method that every  class that implements it being either clothes, vegetables or fruits, is going to have that accept method inside of it so let’s look over here at what the clients going to do to further explain what’s going on over here. First we created TaxVisitor Class, and then we defined one of our class objects so we are going to find a dress as clothes and we say that it has a price of thirty dollars what then is going to happen is this thirty dollars  is going to come over here and how we get this double which visitor is a return value is  we call visitor using method overloading is going to say okay you passed me a clothes so I’m going to use the method visit and I’m going to perform a tax calculation bounce that back as a double and then that double goes right here which we can of course receive right here what this is going to allow us to do is to create completely different ways of taxing different objects as well as very easily implementing  new ways of taxing just by implementing the Visitor interface.
